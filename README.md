# Sprint 1: Flexbox Assignment

Today's assignment is to learn how to use flexbox – a more modern way of layouting pages in css. 

**Why use flexbox?** Flexbox is a much easier way of making layout in CSS, however flexbox is not alway supported in all browsers yet and therefore it is also good to know how to do it the old fashion way. 

This assignment will be in two parts. 

1. Do the excercises on ![Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) 1-24 to really understand how Flexbox works. 

2. Do you remember your Yearbook assignment from earlier this sprint? Let's update it to instead use Flexbox.

## How to complete this assignment

Start by read up a little about flexbox. We gathered a few link below to better understand what it is and how to use it. We also included a great link to see how different technologies are supported in browser. Go check out flexbox and what support it have! [Can I use?](https://caniuse.com/)

Part 1. Go to ![Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) and do the excercises 1-24. 

Part 2. To complete this assignment, you need to fork this repository, copy your code from the Yearbook assignment into the new repositoty, refactor your old code to use flexbox instead, and then submit a pull request on GitHub (from your repository into the technigo one) for review. Read the guide on GitHub for more info on how to do this. Important is that you keep your old code in your old Yearbook repository and make the updates in this new one. 

The `starter-code` folder containers a boilerplate code, like last time. Feel free to use this as your file structure and copy your code into these.
