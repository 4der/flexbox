# Sprint 1: Flexbox Assignment

Today's assignment is to learn how to use flexbox – a more modern way of laying out content with css.

**Why use flexbox?** Flexbox is a much easier way of making layout in CSS, however flexbox is not fully supported in all browsers and therefore it is good to know how to do it the old fashioned way.

This assignment will be in two parts.

1. Do the exercises on [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com) 1-24 to really understand how Flexbox works.

2. Do you remember your [Yearbook Assignment](https://github.com/Technigo/assignment-yearbook) from earlier this sprint? Let's update it to instead use Flexbox.


## How to complete this assignment

Start by reading up a little on flexbox. We gathered a few links below to help you better understand what it is and how to use it. We also included a great link to see how different technologies are supported in different browsers. Go check out flexbox and what support it has! [Can I use?](https://caniuse.com/)

Part 1. Go to [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com) and do the exercises 1-24.

Part 2. To complete this assignment, you need to fork this repository, copy your code from the Yearbook assignment into the new repository, refactor your old code to use flexbox instead, and then submit a pull request on GitHub (from your repository into the Technigo one) for review. Important — make sure that you keep your old code in your old Yearbook repository and make the updates in this new one.

The `starter-code` folder containers a boilerplate code, like last time. Feel free to use this as your file structure and copy your code into these.

### :runner: Stretch Goals

Done with the main task? Here's some ideas for things to continue with:

1. Make your yearbook responsive. Make the photo grid 4 columns on desktop, 2 columns on tablet and 1 column on mobile.
2. Revisit the stretch goals from the Yearbook Assignment, if you haven't finished those.
